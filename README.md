This silly little RGB matrix board is specifically designed to be glued to the back of a standard North American single gang blank wallplate & fit inside the opening of a WireMold surface mount box.

> [!NOTE]
> It is distinctly possible that not ALL of tthe decoupling capacitors(C1-C96) are actually required.
> (Tho it is certain that some of them are...)

> [!CAUTION]
> This board currently has no reverse-polarity protection.
> 
> It also now has footprints for an optional 800uf of bulk capacitance in the form of tantalum capacitors.
> 
> Reverse-polarity power will not only fry the poor LEDs, it'll potentially cause **BOOM** noises.
