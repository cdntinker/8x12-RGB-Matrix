This silly little RGB matrix board is specifically designed to be glued to the back of a standard North American single gang blank wallplate & fit inside the opening of a WireMold surface mount box.

***Note:***

This board currently has no reverse-polarity protection.

It also now has footprints for an optional 800uf of bulk capacitance in the form of tantalum capacitors.

Reverse-polarity power will not only fry the poor LEDs, it'll potentially cause **BOOM** noises.
